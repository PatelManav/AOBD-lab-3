        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n",

        "While the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to teach agents to act in the real, physical world, games provide a convenient proving ground for developing RL algorithms and agents. Games have some properties that make them particularly well suited for RL: \n",
        "\n",
        "1.   In many cases, games have perfectly describable environments. For example, all rules of chess can be formally written and programmed into a chess game simulator;\n",
        "2.   Games are massively parallelizable. Since they do not require running in the real world, simultaneous environments can be run on large data clusters; \n",
        "3.   Simpler scenarios in games enable fast prototyping. This speeds up the development of algorithms that could eventually run in the real-world; and\n",
        "4.   ... Games are fun! \n",
        "\n",
        "In previous labs, we have explored both supervised (with LSTMs, CNNs) and unsupervised / semi-supervised (with VAEs) learning tasks. Reinforcement learning is fundamentally different, in that we are training a deep learning algorithm to govern the actions of our RL agent, that is trying, within its environment, to find the optimal way to achieve a goal. The goal of training an RL agent is to determine the best next step to take to earn the greatest final payoff or return. In this lab, we focus on building a reinforcement learning algorithm to master two different environments with varying complexity. \n",

It provides several pre-defined environments for training and testing reinforcement learning agents, including those for classic physics control tasks, Atari video games, and robotic simulations. To access the Cartpole environment, we can use `env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\")`, which we gained access to when we imported the `gym` package.

Much like you might use `numpy.random.seed`, we can call the comparable function in gym, `seed`, with our defined environment to ensure the environment's random variables are initialized the same each time."

        "We're almost ready to begin the learning algorithm for our agent! The next step is to compute the rewards of our agent as it acts in the environment. Since we (and the agent) is uncertain about if and when the game or task will end (i.e., when the pole will fall), it is useful to emphasize getting rewards **now** rather than later in the future -- this is the idea of discounting. This is a similar concept to discounting money in the case of interest. ecall from lecture, we use reward discount to give more preference at getting rewards now rather than later in the future. The idea of discounting rewards is similar to discounting money in the case of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "To compute the expected cumulative reward, known as the **return**, at a given timestep in a learning episode, we sum the discounted rewards expected at that time step $t$, within a learning episode, and projecting into the future. We define the return (cumulative reward) at a time step $t$, $R_{t}$ as:\n",

Intuitively, you can think of this function as depreciating any rewards received at later time steps, which will force the agent prioritize getting rewards now. Since we can't extend episodes to infinity, in practice the computation will be limited to the number of timesteps in an episode -- after that the reward is assumed to be zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "Take note of the form of this sum -- we'll have to be clever about how we implement this function. Specifically, we'll need to initialize an array of zeros, with length of the number of time steps, and fill it with the real discounted reward values as we loop through the rewards from the episode, which will have been saved in the agents memory. What we ultimately care about is which actions are better relative to other actions taken in that episode -- so, we'll normalize our computed rewards, using the mean and standard deviation of the rewards across the learning episode.\n"

Instead, we'll be able to reuse it later on by passing in our new model we've just created, `pong_model`. This is awesome because our action function provides a modular and generalizable method for all sorts of RL agents!"

However, in getting ready to apply these to a new game like Pong, we might need to make some slight modifications. \n",

Otherwise, we expect the reward at a timestep to be zero -- the players (or agents) are just playing eachother. So, after a game ends, we will need to reset the reward to zero when a game ends. This will result in a modified reward function."

        "\n",
        "We're now set up to define our key action algorithm for the game of Pong, which will ultimately be used to train our Pong agent. This function can be thought of as a \"rollout\", where the agent will 1) make an observation of the environment, 2) select an action based on its state in the environment, 3) execute a policy based on that action, resulting in some reward and a change to the environment, and 4) finally add memory of that action-reward to its `Memory` buffer. We will define this algorithm in the `collect_rollout` function below, and use it soon within a training block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Earlier you visually inspected the raw environment frames, the pre-processed frames, and the difference between previous and current frames. As you may have gathered, in a dynamic game like Pong, it can actually be helpful to consider the difference between two consecutive observations. This gives us information about the movement between frames -- how the game is changing. We will do this using the `pong_change` function we explored above (which also pre-processes frames for us).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use differences between frames as the input on which actions will be selected. These observation changes will be forward propagated through our Pong agent, the CNN network model, which will then predict the next action to take based on this observation. The raw reward will be computed. The observation, action, and reward will be recorded into memory. This will loop until a particular game ends -- the rollout is completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we will define `collect_rollout` such that a batch of observations (i.e., from a batch of agent-environment worlds) can be processed serially (i.e., one at a time, in sequence). We will later utilize a parallelized version of this function that will parallelize batch processing to help speed up training! Let's get to it."

Since RL agents start off with literally zero knowledge of their environment, it can often take a long time to train them and achieve stable behavior. To alleviate this, we have implemented a parallelized version of the RL algorithm, `parallelized_collect_rollout`, which you can use to accelerate training across multiple parallel batches.\n",

Note that, even with parallelization, completing training and getting stable behavior will take quite a bit of time (estimated at least a couple of hours).
